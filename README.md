--->bored as hell...life is hell...but my fiance and my kids are my light when it's all dark
I just want to be able to contribute...make some money to help out 
But I had a head injury sometimes it's hard for me to comprehend new information but they said that would heal in time but that's why I'm here

I want to at least try to learn something because disability ain't going to do nothing and I know there's opportunities on here I just don't 
know where to start. That's me in the nutshell if there's any open source somebody wants to invite me to and explain to me it would be greatly appreciated but I know it's a long shot
